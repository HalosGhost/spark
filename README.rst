spark
=====

This is a C library implementation of `holman/spark <https://github.com/holman/spark>`_ paired with a simple command-line tool to access the library.

With the CLi tool, this serves as a simple replacement for holman/spark; with the library, you can reasonably use sparklines in any C project you can link it into.
